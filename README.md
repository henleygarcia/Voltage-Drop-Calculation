# Voltage Drop Calculation

Voltage Drop Calculation by Henley Garcia

# What is Voltage Drop?

Voltage drop is the energy supplied by a voltage source is reduced as electric current moves through the passive elements (elements that do not supply voltage) of an electrical circuit. Note: this for direct current circuits that are used for Fire Alarm systems. Just a little fun side project I did for my father.

Basically this program calculates it this through wire types in order to calculate Voltage Drop.
